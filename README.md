Haaii I'm Airy, Sun or Kiro as my friends refer me to!

★I am a artist beginning to try new styles and different ways of traditional art!
I really enjoy a lot of things, and i'm quite interested in the fandoms i'm in most of the time!

★Fandoms I'm in that I remember: Gravity Falls!, PHIGHTING!, PPT, OBC(object shows), Fnaf, Ponytown?, Southpark + hellpark(?), and more!

Feel free to talk to me! Even though I might not respond since my notifications are wacky— I'll respond when free!
